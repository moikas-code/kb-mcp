# Vector Search Test

This document tests the semantic search capabilities of the knowledge base system.

## AI and Machine Learning
The system uses transformer models for generating embeddings. These neural networks convert text into high-dimensional vector representations that capture semantic meaning.

## Graph Databases
FalkorDB stores the knowledge graph with vector embeddings for similarity search. This enables semantic queries beyond simple keyword matching.
