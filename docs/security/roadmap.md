# Security Compliance Roadmap

## Current Status: SOC2-Ready Architecture

KB-MCP currently provides **frameworks and structures** for enterprise security and SOC2 compliance, but is **not yet fully compliant**. This document outlines our honest assessment and roadmap.

## ‚úÖ Currently Implemented (SOC2-Ready)

### 1. Security Framework Architecture
- **Type definitions** for SOC2 controls and audit events
- **Configuration structures** for security policies
- **Monitoring interfaces** for metrics and alerting
- **Encryption types** and key management interfaces

### 2. Audit Logging Framework
- Structured audit event types (auth, authz, data_access, etc.)
- Metadata tracking with trace IDs
- PII field identification for GDPR
- Retention policy configurations

### 3. Access Control Models
- RBAC/ABAC/PBAC interface definitions
- Permission and role structures
- Session management types
- Rate limiting configurations

## ‚ùå Implementation Gaps

### 1. **Security Controls Not Active**
- Authentication system exists in types only
- Encryption at rest not implemented
- MFA framework defined but not working
- Audit logs write to console, not secure storage

### 2. **Missing Operational Controls**
- No incident response procedures
- No vulnerability management program
- No access review processes
- No change management controls

### 3. **No Compliance Documentation**
- Risk assessments not performed
- Security policies not written
- Control testing procedures missing
- Vendor assessments not done

## üéØ SOC2 Compliance Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Security Implementation (Q1 2025)
- [ ] Implement working authentication with JWT/OAuth2
- [ ] Add real MFA with TOTP using speakeasy library
- [ ] Enable AES-256-GCM encryption at rest
- [ ] Deploy audit logging to secure storage (S3/SIEM)
- [ ] Implement session management and timeouts

### Phase 2: Access Controls & Monitoring (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Activate RBAC with role-based permissions
- [ ] Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] Deploy monitoring with Prometheus/OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Implement alerting for security events
- [ ] Add health checks and uptime monitoring

### Phase 3: Compliance Documentation (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Write comprehensive security policies
- [ ] Conduct annual risk assessment
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Create change management processes
- [ ] Establish vendor management program

### Phase 4: SOC2 Audit Preparation (Q4 2025)
- [ ] Engage SOC2 auditor for gap assessment
- [ ] Implement any missing controls
- [ ] Conduct 6-month operational period
- [ ] Complete SOC2 Type II audit
- [ ] Receive SOC2 certification

## üö® Legal Disclaimer

**KB-MCP is NOT currently SOC2 compliant.** We provide enterprise-ready security frameworks that can support SOC2 compliance, but actual compliance requires:

1. **Technical Implementation** of all security controls
2. **Operational Procedures** for incident response and access management
3. **Formal SOC2 Audit** by qualified third-party auditor
4. **Continuous Monitoring** and annual re-certification

Organizations requiring SOC2 compliance should:
- Complete the technical implementation roadmap above
- Engage qualified SOC2 auditor
- Implement operational security procedures
- Allow 12-18 months for full certification process

## üìû Enterprise Support
